"""Same-origin proxy to the py_pg_email API.

The client runs behind a Cloudflare Tunnel that terminates TLS, so all
browser fetches must go to the same origin (https://email.peristyle.ai).
Calling the bare HTTP API URL (http://192.168.4.41:5003/api/...) would
be blocked by the browser as mixed content.

This blueprint catches every GET/POST/PUT/DELETE under /api/* and
forwards it to MAIL_SERVER_API_URL/api/* using the JWT from the Flask
session, then copies the response back. The JS only ever sees same-origin
HTTPS URLs.

Only routes that need to be hit from browser JS are exposed. Mail-server
admin endpoints (whitelist, blacklist, etc.) are not proxied - those go
through the server-side MailServerAPI wrapper which uses requests and
isn't subject to the browser mixed-content rule.
